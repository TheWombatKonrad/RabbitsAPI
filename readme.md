This is a private project that I have been working on. While this public copy should always be functional, it is currently unfinished and very rudimentary. The goal of the project is a website where users can register and post images of their rabbits. The project really only exists for fun and to practice programming, and the website will probably never be published.

Currently, only the API is finished, and it is only possible to add users and rabbits.
